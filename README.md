# US-economy
Estimate and analyse a simple model of the US economy
The necessary data is in three csv files, as follows:
1. The file ‘2021-12.csv’. The file containing 127 monthly US economic time series
statistics from Mathew McCraken’s FRED-MD project
(https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/mccracken/fred-databases/).
2. The file ‘fred_md_desc.csv’ – a file containing a variety of summary data for the
FRED-MD data.
3. ‘NBER_DATES.csv’ – a table containing the dates of US economic recessions
and expansions as identified by the US National Bureau of Economic Research
(https://www.nber.org).
The output of my model is then used to build a regression model for five economic time
series, also extracted from the database.
